This repo is to show my understanding of PODEM(an ATPG algorithm) in proj3, and deductive fault simulator in proj2. I follow the instruction of ece6140 from Prof. Abhijit Chatterjee at Georgia Tech.
 --Hopefully I can got a HR to see this and give me an interview on DFT jobs :>


If you are my fellow ece6140 student. Please do NOT cheat
