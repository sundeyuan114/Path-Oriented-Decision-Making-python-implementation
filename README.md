This repo is to show my understanding of PODEM(an ATPG algorithm) in proj3, and deductive fault simulator in proj2. I follow the instruction of Digital Systems Test from Prof. Abhijit Chatterjee at Georgia Tech.


If you are my fellow ece student. Please do NOT cheat. Prof Chat is a great professor dedicating himself in field of testing and validation. I promise if you spend time on your own to finish the project you will truly construe the field of dft & validation.
